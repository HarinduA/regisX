This program serves as an interactive tool for evaluating student progression based on their academic credits in PASS, DEFER, and FAIL categories. Users, either students or staff, input their credit data, which the program validates to ensure it totals 120. Based on this input, it determines the student's outcome, classifying it as Progress, Progress (module trailer), Module retriever, or Exclude. The program then records each result and provides a graphical representation through a histogram, illustrating the distribution of outcomes. This visualization helps in quickly grasping the performance trends. The tool also saves all the entered data to a file, offering a persistent record for future reference. Designed to be user-friendly, the program guides users through the input process, ensuring accurate and meaningful results.
